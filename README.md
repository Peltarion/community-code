# community-code

The Community-code repo includes different kinds of code that helps you integrate with the Peltarion Platform. It can be code for data transforms, calling your model, or just having fun with deep learning.

## Tutorial resources
* [car_damage_classification](./car_damage_classification) - Dataset preprocessing and off-platform evaluation for the tutorial "Classifying car damages".
* [fruit_classification](./fruit_classification) - Dataset preprocessing and off-platform evaluation for the upcoming tutorial "Classifying fruits".
* [skin_lesion_segmentation](./skin_lesion_segmentation) - Dataset preprocessing and off-platform evaluation for the upcoming tutorial "Skin lesion segmentation".
* [yeast_dna](./yeast_dna) - Dataset preprocessing and off-platform evaluation for the tutorial "Gene expression prediction".

For more information about the tutorials, see the [Knowledge Center tutorials](https://peltarion.com/knowledge-center/tutorials).

## Deplyment API examples
* [Peltarion_deployment_curl_examples.ipynb](./Peltarion_deployment_curl_examples.ipynb) - Jupyter Notebook demonstrating use of the deployment API via Curl.
* [Peltarion_deployment_JSON_examples.ipynb](./Peltarion_deployment_JSON_examples.ipynb) - Jupyter Notebook demonstrating use of the deployment API with HTTP requests and JSON body content.
 
*Note:* You may use [Sidekick](https://github.com/Peltarion/sidekick) as an easy-to-use anlternative to direct HTTP calls for sending data to your deployed models. For example code, see the tutorial resources, e.g., car_damage_classification, skin_lesion_semgentation, and fruit_classification.  

Other resources
* [images](./images) - Images used in code examples.
* [solar_panels](./solar_panels) - Dataset preprocessing and off-platform analysis for a training example that is related to predictive maintenance of solar panels.
* [skin_lesion_classification](./skin_lesion_classification) - Dataset preprocessing and off-platform analysis for a training example that is related to the classification of skin lesions.
